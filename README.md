# ImageKit transformer for Imager X

A plugin for using [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io/) as a transformer in Imager X.   
Also, an example of [how to make a custom transformer for Imager X](https://imager-x.spacecat.ninja/extending.html#transformers).

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 5.0.0-beta.1 or later, [Imager X 5.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/spacecatninja/craft-imager-x/) or later,
and an account at [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io/).
 
## Usage

Install and configure this transformer as described below. Then, in your [Imager X config](https://imager-x.spacecat.ninja/configuration.html), 
set the transformer to `imagekit`, ie:

```
'transformer' => 'imagekit',
``` 

Transforms are now by default transformed with ImageKit, test your configuration with a 
simple transform like this:

```
{% set transform = craft.imagerx.transformImage(asset, { width: 600 }) %}
<img src="{{ transform.url }}" width="600">
<p>URL is: {{ transform.url }}</p>
``` 

If this doesn't work, make sure you've configured a `defaultProfile`, have a profile with the correct name, and 
that ImageKit is configured correctly.

### Cave-ats, shortcomings, and tips

This transformer only supports a subset of what Imager X can do when using the default `craft` transformer. 
All the basic transform parameters are supported, with the following exceptions:

- Focal points are translated to focus anchor points (ie `top`, `left`, `center`, etc).  
â€“ Watermarks are not translated automatically from Imager syntax to ImageKit's, but you can still add watermarks by manually passing them through the `transformerParams` object (see below).   
- No effects are currently converted automatically.    

To pass additional options directly to ImageKit, you can use the `transformerParams` transform parameter and pass them in using an `options` object. Example:

```
{% set transforms = craft.imagerx.transformImage(asset, 
    [{width: 400}, {width: 600}, {width: 800}], 
    { ratio: 2/1, transformerParams: { rotation: 45 } }
) %}
```   

Refer to the [ImageKit PHP SDK](https://github.com/imagekit-developer/imagekit-php) for parameters to use, and the
[ImageKit documentation](https://docs.imagekit.io/) for more information.


## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions:

1. Install with composer via `composer require spacecatninja/imager-x-imagekit-transformer` from your project directory.
2. Install the plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins, or from the command line via `./craft plugin/install imager-x-imagekit-transformer`.


## Configuration

You can configure the transformer by creating a file in your config folder called
`imager-x-imagekit-transformer.php`, and override settings as needed.

### publicKey [string]
Default: `''`  
Public key for your ImageKit account (Developer Options > API Keys, in ImageKit).

### privateKey [string]
Default: `''`  
Private key for your ImageKit account (Developer Options > API Keys, in ImageKit).

### signUrls [bool]
Default: `false`  
Toggle this on to generate signed URLs. This is required if "Restrict unsigned image URLs" in 
Settings > Images > Security is turned on.

### signedUrlsExpireSeconds [int]
Default: `31536000` (one year)   
Duration for signed URLs. 

### stripUrlQueryString [bool]
Default: `true`  
By default all query strings are stripped from full URLs passed to ImageKit, to improve
caching. If you use full URLs that rely on query strings, you can toggle this off to make
them work. 

### profiles [array]
Default: `[]`  
Profiles are usually a one-to-one mapping to the URL endpoints you've created in ImageKit. But due to the
nature of ImageKit URL endpoints, where you can mix different storages per endpoint, it could also make sense 
to create several profiles for one endpoint for different use-cases (ie, one to use as a web proxy and the other
for relative paths).
You set the default profile to use using the `defaultProfile` config setting, and can override it at the 
template level by setting `profile` in your `transformerConfig`.

Example profile:

```
'profiles' => [
    'default' => [
        'urlEndpoint' => 'https://ik.imagekit.io/myurlendpoint',
        'isWebProxy' => false,
        'useCloudSourcePath' => true,
    ],
    'proxy' => [
        'urlEndpoint' => 'https://ik.imagekit.io/myotherurlendpoint',
        'isWebProxy' => true
    ]
],
```

Each profile has the following settings:

#### urlEndpoint [string]
Default: `''`       
This is the URL endpoint you created in ImageKit.

#### isWebProxy [bool]
Default: `false`       
Indicates if the URL endpoint uses a web proxy or not. If enabled, full URLs will be passed to ImageKit, 
instead of the relative path to the asset.

#### defaultParams [array]
Default: `[]`       
Default params to be passed to every transform.

#### useCloudSourcePath [bool]
Default: `false`       
If enabled, Imager will prepend the Craft file system path to the asset path, before adding it to the 
ImageKit URL. This makes it possible to have one ImageKit source pulling images from many Craft file systems 
when they are for instance on the same S3 bucket, but in different subfolder. This only works on file systems that 
implements a path setting (AWS S3 and GCS does, local volumes does not).

#### addPath [string|array]
Default: `[]`       
Prepends a path to the asset's path. Can be useful if you have 
several volumes that you want to serve with one ImageKit source. If this setting is an array, the key 
should be the volume handle, and the value the path to add.

### defaultProfile [string]
Default: `''`  
Sets the default profile to use (see `profiles`). You can override profile at the transform level by setting it through the `transformParams` transform parameter. Example:

```
{% set transforms = craft.imagerx.transformImage(asset, 
    [{width: 800}, {width: 2000}], 
    { transformerParams: { profile: 'myotherprofile' } }
) %}
```

### defaultParams [array]
Default: `[]`  
Default params to pass to all transforms.

### purgeEnabled [bool]
Default: `true`  
Toggles automatic purging on/off.
